Mutex Implementation

The server makes a unique mutex for each folder found in the directory of server.c, these mutexes are used to lock specific functions that are being done on the same project.

Multi-Threading

The server creates a new thread for each connection, and sends it to the function “dostuff2”, which handles whatever command the client has sent it. When it finishes it closes the socket.
